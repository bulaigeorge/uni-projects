1. The program compiles by BSTtest.java where is the main function.
2. Because some fuctions did not have a Node object as parameter, it was necessary for me
to create some functions in the Node class.
The remove function, is something im not so proud of, i think there are better ways to
implement it.
3. As i tested everything along the way and the BSTtest works as intedended, i assume
that the functions are working as asked.
